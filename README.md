This project is focused on a log4net viewer developed in .Net/WPF. The control contained in the YalvLib sub-project is a native WPF (look-less) control that can easily be used in IoCs, such as, AvalonDock or PRISM (since it follows MVVM).

The YalvLib control is a refactored version of the Yalv project published on codeplex:
https://yalv.codeplex.com/

Please review the Documentation page to see its full list of features.
This control is MVVM compliant and can be used in a theming context as the EDI project, which is based on AvalonDock:
