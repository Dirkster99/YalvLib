Modern UI Problems

- How can I use the just the Windows Chrome without the page navigation stuff?

- How can I change programatically from one page to the other?
  Example:
  Go to Start Page and click on a recent file entry to open a file.

  Problem: The user has to manually click on View to see the loaded content

- How do I include my own (dark) theming styles into the modern ui theme?
  eg.: Hyperlink styles?

- How do I persist modern ui settings?

- What Resource is the appearance color?
  {DynamicResource AccentColor}
  WindowBackgroundColor
